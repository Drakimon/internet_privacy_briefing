Introduction
	Why you might want to know this stuff
		-Protect yourself while organizing political action, speaking on dangerous topics, etc.
		-Juke data collection and predictive algorithms
		-Get around internet censorship (ex. The Great Firewall of China)
		-Explore the darknet
		-Generally protect yourself from the eyes of those that might want to harm you for whatever you do online
	It's more likely now than ever before that the internet will become a restricted resource, rather than an open system as we are accustomed to it being
	Thanks to people like Trump and his appointee Ajit Pai

	Recent events give reason to be concerned about our government's respect for internet privacy

CASUAL LEVEL
	Let's get some of you out of here early if you want to keep it simple
	Install (and use) the following programs:
		-Signal
			Encrypted, safe messaging and calling
			Easy to use, open source
			Free, well-designed, and available both on Google Play store and in the Apple App Store
			If you wanna be sure of your safety, use this through a VPN
			DO THIS FOR ANYTHING POTENTIALLY COMPROMISING. NO EXCEPTIONS.
		-NordicVPN or Cyberghost or any number of other VPN services
			Remember, you don't need these on ALL of the time
			Don't complain to me when your internet isn't that fast
			There are plenty of good services out there, but READ THE PRIVACY POLICY
			Many have free trials and free versions, though the paid versions are far preferable
		-Tor
			It's Firefox but safe as fuck
			Like Firefox, it is free and open source
			Uses layers of encrpytion to bounce your browsing around a network of proxies, with none of them knowing who you are or what you are doing, only where to pass your data next.
			Keep it up to date (it will help you make sure of this) and NEVER enable JavaScript
			This browser does not protect you from malicious software, so you still need to be a vigilant user/downloader
		-Protonmail
			It's email
			It's encrypted
			It's free
			It cares about you and your well-being
	Remember, these can only protect the communications that you conduct through them
	Use your best judgement to decide what of your communication does and does not deserve that protection
	
TIN HAT WIZARD LEVEL
	This is good if you are:
		-Conducting darknet transactions
		-A whistleblower wanting to get documents into capable hands
		-An average citizen who is just feeling curious, cautious, or maybe even paranoid
	Software
		TAILS
			Linux-based operating system that provides a full suite of useful apps and an impermanent session on any computer you want
			Built on Debian, a relatively popular Linux distro
			Just install on a flash drive, plug it into your favorite computer, boot to it, shut down fully when done with your business
		Tin Hat Linux
			Older, may not be as adapted as Tails. Requires further research.
			Built on a hardened version of Gentoo Linux
			Works similarly to Tails, but is a memory hog. Requires approx 5 GB of RAM or more.
	Worth mentioning that this software, unlike TOR, will require your vigilance to stay up-to-date and as secure as possible
	
/** Encryption (needs work)
	How it works
	Types of encryption, what is outdated and what is still secure
	RSA
		Useful for all sorts of purposes
	PGP
		Useful for encrypting messages
**/

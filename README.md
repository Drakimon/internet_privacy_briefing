# internet_privacy_briefing
A general primer on internet privacy for the average American citizen, with additional info for more advanced folks

This is intended to get the average internet user up to speed on modern internet privacy issues to illustrate why
they should want to protect their privacy, then equip them with the tools and knowledge to do just that.

The presentation will also have a section for more advanced users which will explain different types of encryption,
private operating systems, and so on. The presentation will move slowly enough in introducing these concepts that most
computer-literate people should be able to go from not knowing about Tor to knowing how to install Tails and properly
protect themselves in case they need to become a whistleblower.
